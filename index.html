      Hero section

      This section uses a full‑width background image to create an eye‑catching
      introduction. The overlay class applies a semi‑transparent colour so
      that the text remains legible over the pastel artwork. All of the
      headline and call‑to‑action copy was taken from the original Canva
      landing page referenced by the user request. The text remains editable
      so that future changes can be made without having to regenerate the
      background image.

      Waitlist section

      This form allows visitors to register their interest and join a
      waitlist for updates. When submitted it triggers a mailto link to the
      provided email address, which opens the visitor's email client with
      the form contents pre‑populated. This avoids the need for a server
      back‑end while still collecting contact details.
